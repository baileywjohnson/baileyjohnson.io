I used Flask to build a personal portfolio to supplement my resume.  I liked how easy it was to use Jinja2 for templating and wanted something lightweight to run on my DigitalOcean droplet.

The cards on the projects page were generated using [gh-card](https://github.com/nwtgck/gh-card), and the inspiration for the CSS animations came from [Tobias Ahlin](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/how-to-animate-box-shadow/).
